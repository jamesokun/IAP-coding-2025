    "# L1: Intro to Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll learn the basics of Julia, the programming language that we will be using for this course, by means of an example involving demand estimation.\n",
    "## 0. Julia\n",
    "### 0.1. Overview\n",
    "Julia is a high-performance programming language well-suited for scientific and numerical computing. Some of its defining characteristics are:\n",
    "- Just-in-time (JIT) compilation: Compilation is the process that \"translates\" a higher-level programming language (i.e., a language with a high level of abstraction that is understandable to humans) to a lower-level language (i.e. orders that are understandable to a computer). Julia compiles the code at run time (when the code is executed). It combines some of the speed advantages of ahead-of-time compilation (such as C or C++) with the flexibility and ease of use of interpreted languages (such as Python or R).\n",
    "- Many pre-compiled languages are statically-typed: the type of an object (e.g. integer or string) needs to be annotated for the compiler, and cannot be modified or expressed at run time. Julia is very flexible in that types are themselves run-time objects, but can be declared in advance of compilation to accelerate performance.\n",
    "- Multiple dispatch: Functions can be defined for different types of arguments. Efficient, specialized code can be generated automatically for each type. For example, arithmetic operations between integers and real numbers are handled differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2. Comparison to Other Languages\n",
    "- **Stata:** Stata is great for applied work that involves mostly data cleaning and regressions. It has a very intuitive interface and many ready-made routines covering most econometric methods, without needing a lot of coding / programming from scratch. However, it is not the most suitable language for more customized applications (e.g. simulating data from a structural economic model and estimating counterfactuals). Julia can be much faster than Stata. However, as a relatively new language, it has relatively few pre-made packages (although there is an ```Econometrics.jl``` package that implements different type of regression estimators with a syntax very similar to R).\n",
    "- **R:** Arguably, R is also primarily intended for data analysis, so there are many pre-existing packages for data cleaning and statistics that are well-documented. In comparison, Julia is more of a general programming language, where you can do all sorts of things. Things like numerical optimization and equation-solving, especially, can be much faster and computationally efficient in Julia.\n",
    "- **Python:** Python is, like Julia, more of a general programming language. Julia can be much faster than Python, although Python has been around for longer, and so it has some pre-existing modules that Julia doesn't have (yet), one notable example being Machine Learning. I would say that Julia is especially useful with structural work with custom economic models, requiring numerical optimization or equation-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3. Packages in Julia\n",
    "**Packages** are libraries of functions that add certain capabilites to Julia, from basic tasks such as plotting or loading data to very specific tasks such as computing the NE of a particular class of games. The list of registered Julia packages can be found at http://pkg.julialang.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands for managing packages are found in the ```Pkg``` module, included in Julia's ```Base``` install. To access it, you can use ```import Pkg```, or you can use a closing square bracket ```]``` to enter package mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to **add** (install) packages in Julia:\n",
    "1. Adding the packages directly into your global installation. You do that with:\n",
    "        \n",
    "       import Pkg\n",
    "       Pkg.add(\"MyPackage\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "   or:\n",
    "   \n",
    "       ] add MyPackage\n",
    "       \n",
    "   The packages you install this way will be available everytime in every Julia session on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using a directory with a ```Project.toml``` and a ```Manifest.toml``` files. This method provides an isolated set of packages for a particular project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. The ```Project.toml``` file describes the project on a high level. It has optional fields for project name, version and authors, and it briefly lists the dependencies (packages used) and compatibility constraints.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. The ```Manifest.toml``` file is an absolute record of the state of the packages in the environment. It includes exact information about (direct and indirect) dependencies of the project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Given a ```Project.toml``` and a ```Manifest.toml``` file pair, it is possible to instantiate the exact same package environment every time / everywhere the project is active, which is extremely useful for reproducibility. Hence, this is the recommended method, especially if you are planning to submit your research to a journal that requires replication packages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The way to install packages to a project is the same as before, but when a project is active, the packages will be added to the ```Project.toml``` and ```Manifest.toml``` files, and will be available only within that project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here's how you activate a project in the current directory ```\".\"```:"

    "<b>Coding Tips:</b>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Use <code>const</code> to declare immutable constants (these should not be modified during the execution of the code).</li>\n",
    "    <li> To index a vector or a matrix in Julia (i.e., refer to one of its elements), we use square brackets. For example, if <code>p</code> were a matrix, <code>p[1, 1]</code> would refer to the element in its first row, first column. We can also use a colon, e.g., <code>p[1, :]</code>, to refer to the entire first row (viewed as a vector); this is called \"slicing.\" </li>\n",
    "    <li> When we want apply scalar operations and functions to a vector or a matrix element-wise, we need to \"broadcast\" them. In Julia, this is achieved by using a dot after the function name or before the operation symbol. For example, with <code>exp.(δ .- α .* p[j, :])</code>, we take the exponential of each element of the vector. Some operations (e.g. the sum or difference) needed to be broadcasted in the past, now they don't have to be anymore; I tend to be conservative and broadcast all element-wise operations.</li> \n",
    "    <li> We define functions with <code>function fname(arguments)</code>. We then write all the operations we want the function to perform, and tell Julia what we want the function to output with a <code>return</code> statement. For simple functions, the <code>return</code> statement is not needed; the function will simply return the last variable you compute (see example above). You finally close the function definition with an <code>end</code> statement. Unlike Python, indenting the function definition is not necessary, but I find it improves readability of your code. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Julia makes a distinction between positional and keyword arguments to functions <code>f(pos1, pos2, ... ; kw1, kw2, ...)</code>. When you call the function, positional arguments will be determined by their order, while keyword arguments need to be referred to by name, but can be entered in any order. In our example, <code>shares(p, α=α, δ=δ, ξ=ξ)</code> and <code>shares(ξ=ξ, δ=δ, α=α, p)</code> would give the same result. Also, notice that I am making our functions depend explicitly on the parameters (which are the default values, and so, can be omitted when we call the function). This is because later we are going to estimate the parameters of the model, pretending that we don't know the ground truth, and for our counterfactual computation we will want to use our estimates.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Multiple dispatch: in Julia you can define the same function for different types of arguments, so that the same function can flexibly adapt to its inputs. Here we define a function that computes shares for all towns, when the input is a matrix of prices, or for just one town, when the input is a vector of prices.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Loops: a \"loop\" is a way of telling the computer to perform an operation many times. The previous code snippet contains an example of a \"for\"-loop: <code>for t = 1:T</code>. This tells Julia to perform the operation inside the loop replacing the variable <code>t</code> with each value from 1 to $T$. We also need to close \"for\"-loops with an <code>end</code> statement.\n",
    "    <li> To optimize the performance of your code, it is helpful to declare the type of the arguments. For example, in <code>shares(p::Matrix)</code>, we are telling Julia that the input is a matrix. Similarly, try to initialize objects with the right type, e.g. <code>s = zeros(Float64, T, J)</code>. (\"Floats\" are real, non-integer numbers. The 64 indicates we will use 64 bits of memory to store each number — 64 is the standard, which allows more precision and a larger range of possible values than Float16 or Float32.) You should also preallocate memory when possible. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Notice that I'm writing <code>1.0 .+ sum(exp.(δ .- α .* p[j, :]))</code> rather than <code>1 .+ sum(exp.(δ .- α .* p[j, :]))</code>. The difference is that <code>1.0</code> represents a float (real number) and <code>1</code> is an integer. If you try to add integers and floats, Julia will automatically convert everything to floats and your code will still run properly, but it is faster to operate with objects of the same type.</li>\n",

    "    <li> You can define simple functions in one line with the <code>fname(x) = f(x)</code> rhetoric.</li>\n",
    "    <li> We will learn more about <code>fixedpoint</code> and <code>optimize</code> later in the course. For now, you just need to know that the first argument is the function for which you want to find a fixed point (i.e. F(x) = x) or minimize, and the second argument is the starting value. Functions need to be defined for arrays, rather than scalars, that's why, to extract the solution as a scalar, I index <code>br2 = res.minimizer[1]</code>. </li>\n",
    "    <li> You can also define anonymous functions (without a name) as <code>x -> f(x)</code>. This is useful when the function itself is passed as an argument to another function. For example, in <code>fixedpoint(x -> FOC(x; α=α, δ=δ, ξ=ξ), ones(Float64, T, J))</code>, I am creating an anonymous function that computes the RHS of the firms' FOC after fixing the keyword arguments <code>α, δ, ξ</code>.</li>\n",
    "    <li> A useful syntax to express conditional statements is <code>p = j == 1 ? [own_p, other_p] : [other_p, own_p]</code>. This means: if <code>j == 1</code>, then assign <code>p = [own_p, other_p]</code>, otherwise assign <code>p = [other_p, own_p]</code>.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Expressions with an @ sign are called \"macros.\" Use the macro <code>@time</code> to time the execution of your functions. Notice that the first time you run a function, it takes much longer because of compilation time. By the magic of JIT compilation, when we run the same function again, it doesn't need to be re-compiled, and so it is much faster. Use the macro <code>@show</code> to display results of operations in a nice way. </li>\n",
    "    <li>In the definition of the functions I use <code>c::Matrix{Float64}</code> to let Julia know the type of the global <code>c</code>, which is defined outside the function. This is optional, but it can help greatly reduce compilation time.</li>\n",

    "<b>Coding Tips:</b>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> This example introduces the \"piping\" operator, which allows for functional chaining, i.e. <code>y = x |> f |> g |> h</code> will be the same as <code>y = h(g(f(x)))</code>. It is useful in making the code more readable when the functions are somewhat complex. \n",
    "    Here we are applying three anonymous functions:\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "        <li> The first function returns a dataframe with <code>:t, :s0</code>, then turns the columns <code>:p1, :s1, :c1, :log_rel_share1</code> into a single tuple-valued variable named 1, and columns <code>:p2, :s2, :c2, :log_rel_share2</code> into a single tuple-valued variable named 2. The reason will become clear in the next step.</li>\n",
    "        <li> <code>stack</code> is the function that reshapes dataframes from wide to long. It works very differently from Stata: in Julia, <code>stack(df, [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])</code> will create a long dataframe with two new variables. The first one, named <code>:variable</code> by default, will contain the labels \"x,\" \"y,\" and \"z\" as strings (in our examples, the labels are \"1\" and \"2\" and I'm telling Julia to name this column \"product\"). The second one, named <code>:value</code> will contain the values of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> in the corresponding row. Here, this is a tuple containing <code>:p, :s, :c, :log_rel_share</code> for each product.</li>\n",
    "        <li> The third function \"un-tuples\" the variables in <code>:value</code>.</li>\n",
    "    </ol></li>\n",
    "    <li> Notice that <code>\"&#36;j\"</code> can be used to insert a variable <code>j</code> inside a string. The simplest case <code>[\"$j\" for j in 1:J]</code> just returns <code>[\"1\", \"2\"]</code> but I do recommend using the more complicated expression as a best practice: imagine you decide to have 100 products instead of 2. Then, this way, the code adaps automatically, instead of manually having to find and replace every instance of <code>[\"1\", \"2\"]</code>.</li>\n",
    "    <li> I am also using the <code>*</code> operator to append strings, see examples below.</li>\n",
    "    <li> The function <code>parse(type, x)</code> turns x into a given type. In this case, we are expressing the product back as an integer, rather than a string. This works better with <code>DummyCoding()</code> in the <code>Econometrics</code> package.</li>\n",
