{"name":"IAP-coding","tagline":"","body":"# A Crash Course in Basics of Programming, Replication and Numerical Methods\r\n## MIT IAP 2023\r\n\r\n**Organizer:** Nikhil Agarwal\r\n\r\n**Instructor:** Víctor Quintas-Martínez, vquintas [at] mit [dot] edu\r\n\r\n### Course Description\r\nThis course is intended for students working in Quantitative Economics. It covers the basics of programming and numerical methods, with an emphasis on (a) best practices for replicability and (b) enhancing performance. The course aims to expand quantitative-focused students' toolboxes, familiarizing them with a variety of methods for different numerical problems (e.g. optimization, zero-solving, dynamic programming) and deepening their understanding of how the different algorithms work, their advantages and their disadvantages.\r\n\r\nPrior experience in programming is helpful, but not a prerequisite. The programming language used throughout the course will be Julia. \r\n\r\nThere will be no assignments and no grading, but students are encouraged to run the code in their own and experiment with it.\r\n\r\n### Tentative Schedule\r\nThe course is scheduled to meet for 8 sessions during IAP, M-W 9-10:30am. \r\n\r\nA tentative outline of the course is: \r\n- 01/09: L1. Intro to Programming in Julia\r\n- 01/11: L2. Replicability and Version Control\r\n- 01/16: L3. Function Approximation\r\n- 01/18: L4. Numerical Integration and Differentiation\r\n- 01/23: L7. Differential Equations\r\n- 01/25: L5. Numerical Optimization\r\n- 01/30: L6. Zero-Solvers and Fixed Point Algorithms\r\n- 02/01: L8.
